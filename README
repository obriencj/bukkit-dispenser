This is a plugin for the Bukkit Minecraft server.

The Dispenser plugin adds a number of features to the dispenser blocks
in Minecraft.

Placing a bucket of water of lava inside of a dispenser will cause it
to emit the appropriate fluid from the front whenever redstone power
is applied, and will shut off when power fades.

Placing a slime ball inside of a dispenser and causing it to trigger
will spawn a slime monster.

Placing golden boots inside of a dispenser and causing it to trigger
will make lightning strike the dispenser.

Placing a flint and steel inside of a dispenser and causing it to
trigger will ignite the block in front of the dispenser.

Placing a boat or minecart inside of a dispenser and causing it to
trigger will spawn the appropriate vehicle two blocks in front of the
dispenser.

Ramming a boat or minecart into a dispenser will despawn the vehicle
and cause it to be loaded into the dispenser's inventory. (thanks
